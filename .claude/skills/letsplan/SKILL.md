# Let's Plan

Read @PLAN.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc.

Make sure the questions are not obvious.

Be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the plan to the file.
